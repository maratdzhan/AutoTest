!KEY_DAT_EXP, 0 - without datas of kv and detecrors, 1 - only kv datas,
!2 - only detectors datas, 3 - kv & detectors datas
!LAMBDA_XE & LAMBDA_JOD, WERE TAKEN FROM LIBRARY NAMED ENDF/B-7.1
!NUM_ASSEMB_INDEPENDENT_WITH_DET - is not use now
!TYPE_ASSEMBLEY_INDEPENDENT - types of assembleys that match with burboc massiv of data in which we want change 
!Doppler effect
!WARNING!!! KEY_INDEPENDENT_CORR!!! if it have value 1 that means independent variation of doppler effect in
!assembleys number which match with TYPE_ASSEMBLEY_INDEPENDENT
!key_show_detect_data - response for writing in file detectors data in time which writed in massiv

!KEY_REVERSIVE_DZZ.eq.1, that mean correlation (proportional change) between upper and lower bound conditions
!key_reversive_dzz.eq.-1, that mean anti-correlation (reversive change) between upper and lower bound conditions
!key_reversive.eq.0, that mean dependence between upper and lower bound conditions is absent
